= OpenLid: The Frontend of the Musikverein Leopoldsdorf

This frontend especially written for the Musikverein Leopoldsdorf, provides the frontend functionality to barrel backends such as https://github.com/mvl-at/openkeg[OpenKeg].

== Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

== Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

== Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

== Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

== Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

== Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

== Name Origin

As in many music societies, the consumption of beer and wine is common in the Musikverein Leopoldsdorf.
This makes the barrels and kegs mandatory to be open which are closed by a lid.
So, open the lids!
Luckily, the open prefix is also used for many open source projects.
