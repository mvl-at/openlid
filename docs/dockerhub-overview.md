# OpenLid Multi-Arch Docker Image

## Description
The OpenLid Multi-Arch Docker Image is designed to build and run the 'openlid' application on multiple architectures.
This Docker image leverages the power of Rust and Alpine Linux to provide a lightweight and efficient environment for hosting OpenLid.
The image supports both ARM64 and AMD64 architectures, making it versatile and suitable for various deployment scenarios.

## Features
- Supports ARM64 and AMD64 architectures for broader compatibility.
- Based on Angular, Nginx and Alpine Linux, ensuring a lightweight and efficient container environment.
- Built-in multi-stage build process for optimal image size and security.
- Automatically exposes port 80 for incoming connections.

## Usage
To use the OpenLid Multi-Arch Docker Image, follow these steps:

1. Pull the Docker image:
   ```sh
   docker pull mvlat/openlid:latest
   ```
1. Run the container with the desired configuration:
   ```sh
   docker run -d -p 80:80 -v /path/to/configuration.json:/openlid/assets/configuration.json mvlat/openlid
   ```
The `-p` flag maps port 1926 inside the container to the host, enabling incoming connections.
The `-v` flag allows you to mount a host directory as a volume for persistent data storage.

## Build Configuration:
The build process is designed to be versatile, allowing you to specify the target architecture during the build.
To build the image for a specific architecture, use the following command:

```sh
docker buildx build -t mvlat/openlid:latest --platform=linux/amd64 --platform=linux/arm64 --progress=plain . --push
```
